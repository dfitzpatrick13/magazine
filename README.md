# magazine
Summary

This is a project I Created for Challenge 3 at the Apple Devopler Acadamey We had the freedom to crete whatever we wanted and I have a love for magazines and anime, I have a intrest in AR so wanted to see how I could combine all my skils

Skils learned

I used reailty composer to make the AR scene

I used adobe Indesign to make the actual Magazine file

What I would change for the future of the application

I want to add a menu to choose from different magazine in the future I want to be able to have the magazine pages move and comeback instead of just going on direction

Here is a PDF of the magazine to View magazine_final.pdf
